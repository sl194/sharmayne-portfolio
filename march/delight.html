      <h4>Project Description</h4>
    <p>The project started with the question - how can we drive energy-conscious behavioral changes for people who care but are not sure what to do? We focused on grocery shopping and eating, hoping to bring awareness to people to adopt a plant-rich diet.</p>
     
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Unsupervised children playing with lighters leads to grave consequences (supported by statistics of burns and deaths worldwide). Additionally, lighters which have run out of fuel are rendered useless in situations whereby lighter refills and charging points are unavailable. Our solution prevents children from activating the lighter when they come into contact with it as it has a fingerprint lock that only registered fingerprints are able to unlock. Also, when our lighter has run out of fuel, there is an option to recharge it by winding it. At the same time, our lighter allows children to have fun by playing video games on it or winding it.</p>
      
       <h2>Product Description</h2>
      <p>The key highlighted features of our product are:

Fingerprint Sensor
This capacitive sensor allows us to capture, collect, store and sense fingerprint patterns. This feature is used to restrict access to the lighter.

M5Stick-C
This is the big boi that does most of the work. This mini IoT core device is based on the ESP32 chip and is equipped with common features, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LCD Display, LED, Button, Buzzer, IR Transmitter, Battery and Six-Axis MPU. This allows us to do some cool, unconventional integrations of certain systems that only involve light processing power to the lighter. Such an example would be the simple Game Feature that would run when an unauthorised fingerprint is detected. Note that the fingerprint detection callback still runs asynchronously while the game is running. The game that we currently implement is a simple low-level adaptation of Flappy Bird with balloons as obstacles. Of course, given more time and effort, more intricate games could potentially be written (although care needs to be taken regarding memory usage and the fact that it is very troublesome to write the graphics and physics drivers from scratch). This module also handles the Wi-Fi Feature connectivity and processing.

Plasma Lighter
Instead of using gas fuel, we utilise a more sustainable, reusable and rechargeable energy source such as a battery. A possible case illustration of its sustainability is that this would reduce the amount of plastic unintentionally consumed by animals like birds. The battery could be charged either through the USB port or by using the hand crank.

Speaker
Our product is also equipped with a piezoelectric speaker that provides auditory feedback to convey messages or to reinforce certain actions that the user had done.

Hand Crank
The lighter is equipped with a detachable hand crank that could be wound to provide more energy through its charging circuit.</p>
