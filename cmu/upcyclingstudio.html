      <p>The Upcycle Studio challenges students to reuse retired aircraft windows donated by SIA within an architectural prototype that exemplifies design for circular economy. In the second year of my architectural education, I was given the opportunity for the first time ever to choose my modules -- and I chose this studio as the idea that we could turn parts of a plane into architecture was really exciting! Upcycling was something I was familiar with, but not at such a large scale/not with architecture, so it was really fascinating.</p></div>
     
      <h2>Initial Research on Upcycling Examples</h2>
        
         <div class="row">
  <div class="col3 one" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/us1.jpg"/>
  </div>
        
  <div class="col3 two" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/us12.jpg"/>

  </div>
</div> 
      <p>We began this studio by researching about cool upcycling projects, imbrication/bio-mimetic architecture/patterns as well as small pavilions that inspire us. Personally, I was particularly impressed with Kengo Kuma's China Academy of Arts' Folk Art Museum because of how they tiling discarded from local housing in such creative ways, not only as the roof but also as the facade. This unique use of the different shaped tiles not only helped the gallery fit into both its rural and urban setting, but it also created mesmerising shadows due to the diamond-shaped gaps in the mesh made of roof tiles hung on stainless steel wires.<br><br>Understanding the design of the Gherkin was really eye-opening too. Previously, what was just one of Norman Foster's iconic buildings to me turned out to be something so fascinating as it mimics the shape and lattice structure of the Venus Flower Basket Sponge. The structural elements of the Gherkin are connected at different angles on each floor, creating a lattice-like, diagonally braced structure around the exterior that allows for an open floor plan without interior columns. In addition, similar to how the sponge's round shape provides stiffness and disperse the forces from strong currents, the building's round shape reduces wind deflections and creates the external pressure differentials that drive the natural ventilation system. Air can also flow around the building more smoothly compared to the rectilinear shape of a traditional office tower, and the openness also provides a large amount of natural light penetration.<br><br>Last but not least, I was blown away by the Zero Waste Bistro, which infused the concept of circularity in all of its parts, from the building, to the interior, to the programme, to the furniture. Designed with the philosophy of ‘refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle’, this bistro used recycled food and beverage cartons turned into environmentally friendly building materials and displayed furniture, product, interiors, and food made from 100% no waste and safe material to encourage and promote upcycling in architecture at all stages. Even its dishes comprise of commonly overlooked byproducts of our food system to produce something delicious; and its trays are made from recycled plastics that is also fully recyclable.</p>
      
        <h2>Understanding Circularity</h2>
         <div class="row">
  <div class="col3 one" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/UNEP%20Circularity.png"/>
  </div>
        
  <div class="col3 two" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/UNEP%20Circularity%202.png"/>
  </div>
             
    <div class="col3 three" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/UNEP%20Circularity%203.png"/>
  </div>
</div> 
      <p>After which, I did a quick study to get a better understanding of the circularity concept, its scope and how it contributes to promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns. As outlined by Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, circularity and sustainable consumption and production are essential to delivering on every multilateral agreement, from the Sustainable Development Goals, to the Paris Agreement to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Hence, building circularity is essential to a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, circularity builds upon value retention loops such as Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose and Recycle, with the guiding priciple being Reduce by design.</p>
        
       <h2>Big Shapes, Instantiation, Aggregation</h2>

</div>
      <p>We dabbled in Rhino/Grasshopper with Python scripting and the use of several plugins to generate NURBS forms, populate complex surfaces with structural elements, and computationally aggregate discrete components. We briefly covered analysis based on finite element analysis via Karamba as well as analysis for embodied carbon to understand the structural integrity as well as the environmental impact of our architecture. We generated a series of ‘big shapes’ and then instantiated our components within that big shape before refining the geometry of those components (i.e. connections).</p><br>
          <div class="row">
  <div class="col3 oneee" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/us41.jpg"/>

  </div>
</div>
      <p>On the left, I engaged in divergent ideation, just sketching whatever came to mind to create "big form" sketches of overall pavilion shapes. On the right, I explored different patterns, atmospheres and effects to show my vision for the pavilion.</p><br>
        
        <div class="row">
  <div class="col3 oneee" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/yh1.png"/>

  <div class="col3 twooo" style="background-color:white">
   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/yh2.png"/>
  </div>
</div>
      <p>These are my partner's, Yi Heng's, drawings and what he imagined the pavilion to look like. Based on both our drawings, we decided on a rough circular big form that was similar to a nest of sorts.</p><br>
        
        <div class="row">
  <div class="col3 oneee" style="background-color:white">

   <img style="width:100%; object-fit: contain;" class="profile-image superbig soft-rounded" src="images/wasp.png"/>
  </div>
</div><br><p>On the left, a pattern is created based on a dodecahedral geometry, with some connections inverted to allow for a continuous open figure. Other patterns have been created to show different ways of aggregation by changing some of the x-axis lines in the Grasshopper code. Aggregation geometry is shown in cyan and original components are shown in red at center. On the right, multiple parts have been used to track plexi, wooden, and PLA printed materials to create this aggregation. Material tracking here has permitted calculations of the percent material upcycled as well as percent of biodegradable material.</p>
   
        <h2>Further Explorations</h2>

      <p>We continued iterating on our big form, trying to achieve the organic shape we were imagining and also trying to achieve that shape parametrically instead of manually.</p>
        
      <h2>Mid-review</h2>
      <p>Before we knew it, it came to our mid-term presentation.</p>
      
      <h2>Redesign</h2>
      <p>All teams redesign their proposals based on mid‐review comments. Improving accuracy of model, and refining drawings, renderings, and texts.</p>
      
         <h2>Analyze, Prototype, Communicate</h2>
      <p>Students analyze their designs for structural stability and embodied carbon. Students communicate design intent through annotation, ornament, patterning, or tectonics of the proposed design. Students communicate design intent through a rendering, axonometric technical drawing of a multi‐module pavilion. Students write a short explanatory text. (Single A0 sheet) Each student team designs and builds a one‐to‐one scale prototype of a single module.</p>
      
      <h2>Prototyping, Fabrication</h2>
      <p>Students work as a single team to create a fabrication plan, cut sheets, print files, scaffolding layout if needed, safety checks for fabrication and assembly of the multi‐module prototype. Update and implement strategy for component annotation, communication, ornamentation.</p>
      
      <h2>Assembly, Representation</h2>
      <p>Students assemble all components. Students create additional set of detailed analysis, textual description, technical drawings and renderings for the multi‐module prototype.</p>
      
      <h2>Final review, Exhibition</h2>
      <p>Jury joins to view the final prototype. Students share updated design posters in a gallery. Photography session.</p>
