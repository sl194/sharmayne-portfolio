                        <p>Interning at Kyoob allowed me to grow a lot personally and professionally. I worked on a few planned developments during my time there, such as the Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands Integrated Hub Competitions, as well as the development of new integrated funeral parlour complexes as part of the Government's efforts to meet the anticipated demand for after-death facilities and services amid Singapore's aging population. However, as the drawings are confidential, I'm unable to share them, hence I've come up with a rather general visualisation of how one of the projects I worked on looks like as well as a cute Zoom background I created for the company's internal Zoom meetings. (P.S. I've gotten approval for this) <!--<a class="red" href="https://sutdapac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/sharmayne_lim_mymail_sutd_edu_sg/EZj8VHX7EK1PtSw8P0FbpAQB9Yf3b2QwKWioW_lw3iNqfg?e=nxANl2">Find out more</a>!--></p>

<!--                        <a class="project-link" href="https://mysterious-neat-opinion.glitch.me">Have fun with an augmented reality visualisation here! Even cooler with your phone :)</a>-->
<!--                        <p>My first term of architectural education was plagued with consecutive nights of burning midnight oils, yet it was enriching and fruitful. There were modules I thoroughly enjoyed like <a class="red" href="HTC.html">History, Traditions & Culture</a>, <a class="red" href="CORE.html">Core Studio 1</a> and <a class="red" href="AST.html">Architecture, Science and Technology</a>. However, there were others I struggled with, like <a class="red" href="IDC.html">Introduction to Design Computation</a>. But perseverance led me to have my final project for design computation displayed at our school's architecture exhibition!</p>-->
                    <p>My second term of architectural education was again plagued with many all-nighters, but I had a lot of fun! For our Core Studio II, we had to build an underwater museum that was set in 2200 and we were exposed to new software such as Unreal Engine to create our virtual worlds and with Oculus, we could immerse ourselves in the virtual worlds we created. Another project involved a joint collaboration between two of our modules, Architectural Structures & Enclosure Design as well as Digital Design & Fabrication, where we applied knowledge we have learnt from both subjects to design and build a bridge. My team tried to be innovative and experimented with fungal-like adhesive material (FLAM), a bioplastic that I previously had explored in one of my Undergraduate Research Opportunities (UROP), to fabricate our nodes. During the day of testing, when we witnessed other groups who used metal for their nodes had their bridges collapse from the weights put on it, we just gave each other a pat on the back saying "good job for trying something new". Little did we expect that we were the group that managed to withstand the most weight (i.e. 60kg), despite a relatively low mass of 12.6kg (actually our bridge's structure only weighed 3.4kg, it was our deck that pretty heavy).</p>
