      <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>This project is about the design, development, and launch of the Ami app, a dual-language cognitive training game for older adults that aims to delay the rate of cognitive decline and the onset of dementia. The Ami app originated from a MOH National Innovation Challenge research project called DISC, short for Dual-language Intervention for Semantic memory ‚Äì Computerized. This project was initiated in response to Singapore‚Äôs ageing population. Currently in Singapore, 1 in 10 seniors over the age of 60 suffers from dementia. Bilingualism is known to be beneficial to seniors‚Äô cognitive health. By leveraging technology, not only can we help seniors slow down their cognitive decline, but we can also support caregivers by reducing their load. The data collection period for the project was from 2019 to 2021 in collaboration with Yong En Care Centre and St. Andrew‚Äôs Senior Care.<br><br>According to our study results, playing the Ami app has multiple benefits. Firstly, it can promote elders' cognitive health, secondly, it can improve elders' verbal memory, and thirdly, it can increase elders' interest towards technology use. The Ami app has different games that target different cognitive functions. It also has adaptive prompts and various levels of difficulty. Ami app currently has six languages or dialects for players to choose from: English, Mandarin, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay and Tamil. What sets our game apart is its dual-language feature. Using two languages to play the Ami app can be more beneficial compared to using one language only. The Ami app also has several user-friendly features, including the avatar Ami, which you can click on for help during the game, as well as positive feedback to encourage you while playing.</p>

      <p>Interning at Grab was life-changing. I learnt so, so much and met so many wonderful people from really diverse backgrounds which were all very willing to share their experiences, insights and advice! I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to work on so many important projects and improve the experience of our millions of users! Special thanks to my mentor <a class="green text" href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/an-drew">Andrew</a> and <a class="green text" href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/vikrammanagoli">Vikram</a> for their immense support, guidance and belief in me, without which, I wouldn't have been able to make it so far!</p>
