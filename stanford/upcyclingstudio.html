      <h4>Role</h4>
    <p>Designed the modular system of benches, the circular concept and fabricated the prototypes and final product for the bench</p>

      <h4>Project Description</h4>
    <p>The Upcycle Studio challenges students to reuse retired aircraft windows donated by SIA within an architectural prototype that exemplifies design for circular economy. This studio runs in parallel to and is affiliated with the SUTD X SIA Upcycling Challenge 2021/2022 ‚Äì Giving New Life to Parts from Retired Aircraft.</p>
     
      <h2>Initial Research on Upcycling Examples</h2>
      <p>The project started with the question - how can we drive energy-conscious behavioral changes for people who care but are not sure what to do? We focused on grocery shopping and eating, hoping to bring awareness to people to adopt a plant-rich diet.</p>
      
       <h2>Workshops, Fabrication Training</h2>
      <p>Workshops will take place in Rhino/Grasshopper with Python scripting and the use of several plugins. Workshops will provide a refresh on NURBS form generation in grasshopper, population of complex surfaces with structural elements, and computational aggregation of discrete components. Analysis based on finite element analysis via Karamba as well as analysis for embodied carbon will be covered. Fabrication training is provided for CNC and waterjet. Students exhibit their work at the end of all three workshops in a MIRO board. Students form groups of two at the end of the final workshop.</p>
      
      <h2>Big Shapes, Instantiation, Aggregation</h2>
      <p>Students begin work with aircraft components. Students generate a series of ‚Äòbig shapes‚Äô and in a second step instantiate their components within that big shape. Geometry of components is refined, including connections.</p>
      
      <h2>Analyze, Prototype, Communicate</h2>
      <p>Students analyze their designs for structural stability and embodied carbon. Students communicate design intent through annotation, ornament, patterning, or tectonics of the proposed design. Students communicate design intent through a rendering, axonometric technical drawing of a multi‚Äêmodule pavilion. Students write a short explanatory text. (Single A0 sheet) Each student team designs and builds a one‚Äêto‚Äêone scale prototype of a single module.</p>
      
      <h2>Mid-review</h2>
      <p>Students present their designs and prototypes at midreview. The invited jury of experts vote on one design to be built at larger scale in the second half of the term. Winning designers submit material requests for the larger multi‚Äêmodule prototypes over recess week.</p>
      
      <h2>Redesign</h2>
      <p>All teams redesign their proposals based on mid‚Äêreview comments. Improving accuracy of model, and refining drawings, renderings, and texts.</p>
      
      <h2>Prototyping, Fabrication</h2>
      <p>Students work as a single team to create a fabrication plan, cut sheets, print files, scaffolding layout if needed, safety checks for fabrication and assembly of the multi‚Äêmodule prototype. Update and implement strategy for component annotation, communication, ornamentation.</p>
      
      <h2>Assembly, Representation</h2>
      <p>Students assemble all components. Students create additional set of detailed analysis, textual description, technical drawings and renderings for the multi‚Äêmodule prototype.</p>
      
      <h2>Final review, Exhibition</h2>
      <p>Jury joins to view the final prototype. Students share updated design posters in a gallery. Photography session.</p>
