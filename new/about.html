            <h3>Heylo! Really wanted to say thanks for pushing yourself this hard during internship. Your <a class="aqua text">tenacity and perseverance is truly inspiring, </a>and even sometimes I question myself if I'm working as hard as you 😂 From delivering such a rigorous first 30 days project, to staying up till 2++am for the hackathon, to juggling between part-time internship and school... it's been a really amazing time being able to mentor & work alongside you. I hope you've found your time in Grab to be insightful and really hope you are also recognising the <a class="aqua text">amazing achievements you made over these short months!! </a>I definitely would be rooting for you for all that you'll be doing in the future 🙌
